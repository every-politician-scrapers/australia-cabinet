Taylor was elected as Member for Hume with over 61% of the two-party preferred vote and over 54% of the primary vote. Taylor joined the Government benches under new Prime Minister Tony Abbott as a \"talented and somewhat impatient\" MP, with a suspicious view of government procedures. In an interview early in his parliamentary career he said: I hate, I mean really hate, fart-arsing around. I insist on getting things done. And yet that is what government specialises in.",

Taylor was accused of using $80 million of taxpayers' money to buy water licences from two Queensland properties owned by Eastern Australia Agriculture (EAA). Taylor was a director of EAA, though resigned from his position in November 2009. The Guardian and Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young began circulating reporting on this as #watergate. The Twitter campaign was \"driven by several activists who support independent political candidates challenging Liberal MPs, including former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's son, Alex Turnbull, mining heir Simon Holmes à Court, and former Sydney Morning Herald journalist Margo Kingston.\" The law firm Ashurst LLP was asked to prepare an opinion on the matter. They found that Taylor had never had equity in EAA or any associated company or had any benefit for the sale of any water or land.",

In July 2019 activists launched the #Grassgate hashtag on Twitter (which had also been used for an attack on Pep Guardiola at Manchester City F.C.) and accused him of misleading the Australian Parliament on \"An investigation into illegal land clearing against a company part-owned by the family of federal minister Angus Taylor.\" When questioned concerning his involvement in herbicide use and his subsequent meeting with officials, Taylor informed the Parliament that he was discussing \"long and detailed concerns\" on native grass legislation with a farmer in Yass on 21 February 2017, whereas the Parliamentary Records instead show that Taylor was in Sydney participating in a High Value Data Roundtable discussion. The former environment minister Josh Frydenberg sought urgent information about an investigation by his department against a company in which Taylor and his relatives held an interest. Jam Land, part owned by Taylor and his family, was under investigation for alleged illegal clearing of grasslands at the time. About 30 hectares of the critically endangered grassland known as the natural temperate grassland of the south eastern highlands had been allegedly poisoned at a property in Delegate, New South Wales, in late 2016. The then environment and energy minister, Frydenberg, canvassed whether protections for a critically endangered grassland at the centre of the compliance action could be watered down and if it could be kept secret.",

            "text": "Forged document controversy. In October 2019, Taylor was accused of having forged a City of Sydney Council document and providing that document to The Daily Telegraph. The incident stemmed from a letter the Lord Mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore wrote to the Minister, asking him to declare \"a climate emergency.\" In his reply to her, Taylor criticised her own department's travel — claiming that the City of Sydney Council spent $15.9 million on travel for the 2017–18 period, which he attributed to an annual report document available on the council's website. Moore responded publicly, saying the figures had been altered as the actual annual report showed they had spent less than $6,000 in travel expenses, and that no report with the figures given by Taylor had ever existed. The matter was referred to NSW Police for investigation by the Australian Labor Party. In October 2019, Taylor apologised to Moore for the incorrect figures, though he and his representatives continued to insist the document was obtained from the Council website, despite evidence to the contrary from archived versions of it on Trove. On 26 November 2019, NSW Police announced that they had commenced an investigation. Despite calls from the opposition for Taylor to be stood down during the investigation, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison refused to do so and stated there was \"no action required\" on his behalf. During the NSW Police investigation, Scott Morrison made a phone call to NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller, whom he had a prior relationship as neighbours in Sydney. Both men refused to give details or recordings of the call, although Fuller did say that Morrison did not ask any inappropriate questions, and was only given information that was already in the media release. A former anti-corruption judge said the call appeared to be an attempt by Morrison to influence the investigation. On 1 January 2020, the investigation was referred to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). On 6 February 2020, the AFP announced that they would not continue to pursue an investigation into the origin of the document as it was determined there was no evidence to be found. Clover Moore lodged a formal complaint with the Australian Press Council over The Daily Telegraph article.",

She described his reference to \"elites\" as \"antisemitic dogwhistling.\" A spokesman for Taylor said he never stated Wolf was one of the graduates against the Christmas tree. Taylor denied any form of antisemitism and demanded an apology from her over the claim, stating the accusation was offensive as he had a Jewish grandparent.",
